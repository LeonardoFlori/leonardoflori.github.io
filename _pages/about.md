Currently, I am a first year student at the PhD program in Economics and Finance at Bocconi University. I graduated in Economics at University of Pisa while pursuing the honors program at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. I was research assistant in both the public and the private sector, and worked in financial markets supervision.
