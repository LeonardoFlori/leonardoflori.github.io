Hi there!
I am a third year student in the PhD program in Economics and Finance at Bocconi University. I got a Master of Science in Economics at University of Pisa while pursuing the honors program at Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies. I was research assistant in both the public and the private sector, studying topics that range from asset pricing to monetary economics, and I worked in financial markets supervision.

My main research interests lie in the study of banking and financial economics.
